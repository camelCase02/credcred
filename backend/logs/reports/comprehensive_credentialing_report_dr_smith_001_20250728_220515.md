## 4. Risk Assessment

- **High Confidence, Low Risk:** All hard compliance requirements fully and recently verified (confidence score 1.0).
- **Potential Documentation Gaps:**
  - **Employment History:** Only post-2013 work at UCSF is detailed; earlier roles not specified.
  - **CME Detail:** Aggregate credit count is robust, but lack of itemization limits full auditability.
- **Malpractice and Background Risk:** None—no claims or legal events reported or found.
- **Expiration Monitoring Needed:** Malpractice insurance and board certification approach renewal dates; routine tracking required.

## 5. Process Transparency

- **Credentialing Workflow:**  
  1. Provider data retrieval  
  2. Data mapping to eight regulatory requirements  
  3. API-powered primary source verification (license, board, insurance, background, etc.)  
  4. Sequential review of all "hard" and "soft" regulations  
  5. Automated compliance scoring and decision generation

- **AI Reasoning & Auditable Steps:**
  - No subjective/unsupported AI overrides; all decision points transparently documented.
  - Stepwise logic and rules aligned with industry best practices.
  - Data-driven explanations accompany every regulatory decision.
- **Verification Confidence:**  
  - **1.0 ("Full confidence")** recorded for the validation of all compliance-critical attributes (i.e., no AI-detected ambiguity or errors).
