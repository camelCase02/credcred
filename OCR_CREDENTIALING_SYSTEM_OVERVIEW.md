### 3. Comprehensive Credentialing Rules JSON
**File:** `credentialing_rules.json`

**Contains:**
- **25 Hard Rules (Mandatory Requirements):**
  - Professional Licensing (Medical License, DEA Registration)
  - Board Certification Requirements
  - Education Verification (Medical School, Residency)
  - Hospital Privileges and Status
  - Malpractice Insurance Coverage
  - Background Checks and Sanctions
  - Work History and References
  - Health Status and Immunizations
  - Regulatory Compliance (OSHA, CPR, HIPAA)
  - Continuing Medical Education

- **20 Soft Rules (Preferred Qualifications):**
  - Advanced Certifications and Fellowship Training
  - Research and Academic Contributions
  - Professional Leadership Experience
  - Technology and Innovation Adoption
  - Patient Care Excellence Metrics
  - Cultural Competency and Language Skills
  - Teaching and Mentorship Experience
  - Network Adequacy Considerations
  - Quality Improvement Participation
  - Community Involvement

### 4. Detailed Credentialing Document
**File:** `healthcare_credentialing_rules_document.md`

A comprehensive 30+ page document covering all aspects of healthcare provider credentialing based on industry standards from:
- CAQH (Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare)
- NCQA (National Committee for Quality Assurance)
- Joint Commission standards
- CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) requirements
- FSMB (Federation of State Medical Boards) guidelines

## Technical Implementation

### OCR Processing Simulation
- **Text Extraction:** Simulates realistic OCR text extraction from various document types
- **Confidence Scoring:** Provides OCR confidence levels (0.7-1.0 range)
- **Document Recognition:** Automatically identifies document types based on content
- **Field Extraction:** Parses key information using regex patterns

### Rule-Based Evaluation Engine
- **Hard Rules Processing:** Mandatory requirements with pass/fail evaluation
- **Soft Rules Scoring:** Weighted scoring system for preferred qualifications
- **Evidence Collection:** Extracts text evidence supporting rule compliance
- **Keyword Matching:** Advanced keyword matching with context awareness
- **Confidence Metrics:** Provides confidence levels for each rule evaluation

### Compliance Scoring Algorithm
```
Overall Score = (Hard Rules % × 70%) + (Soft Rules % × 30%)

Where:
- Hard Rules % = (Compliant Hard Rules / Total Hard Rules) × 100
- Soft Rules % = (Earned Soft Points / Maximum Soft Points) × 100

Thresholds:
- ≥80%: Compliant
- 60-79%: Conditional Approval
- <60%: Non-Compliant
```

### Data Management
- **JSON Structure:** Comprehensive rule definitions with metadata
- **Document Processing:** Tracks processing status and results
- **Export Capabilities:** JSON export for integration and reporting
- **Analytics:** Real-time processing metrics and compliance statistics

## Integration Points

### Provider Dashboard Integration
- New "OCR Processor" tab added to provider dashboard
- Seamless integration with existing credentialing workflow
- Direct access to document upload and processing features

### Payer Dashboard Integration
- New "Credentialing" tab added to payer dashboard
- Application queue management interface
- Review and approval workflow integration

## Usage Workflow

### For Healthcare Providers:
1. **Upload Documents:** Upload credentialing documents (PDF, images)
2. **OCR Processing:** System extracts text with confidence scoring
3. **Rule Evaluation:** Automated evaluation against 45 credentialing rules
4. **Review Results:** View detailed compliance analysis and evidence
5. **Export Data:** Generate JSON reports for submission

### For Payers/Health Plans:
1. **Application Management:** View and manage incoming credentialing applications
2. **Analytics Dashboard:** Monitor processing metrics and approval rates
3. **Review Queue:** Review applications requiring manual attention
4. **Decision Making:** Approve or reject applications with documented reasons
5. **Reporting:** Generate comprehensive processing reports

## Advanced Features
